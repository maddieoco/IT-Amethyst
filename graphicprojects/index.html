<h1>Design & Image Projects</h1>

<h2> Vector Logo Samples </h2>
<figure> <img src="assets/img/logosample.png" alt="sample vector logo"><figcaption>Logo design for a fictional art and design firm, based on my own fiber-art interests.  </figcaption></figure>
<figure> <img src="assets/img/tutorial-logo.png" alt="star tutorial logo"> <figcaption>My take on the star tutorial, created in Illustrator instead of Gravit. I enjoyed playing around with filters and blend modes as well as clipping masks, all three things that don't normally make it into my workflow. </figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="assets/img/ozarkrush.png" alt="ozark rush logo alternates"><figcaption>Unused logo options for our team project that I designed that didn't make the cut when we looked at them as a group. Ultimately we liked them both but neither fit the mood as well as the final design by Kalyn. The top option was a lot of fun to work on, though- I actually traced parts of the maps provided by our clients to create the mountain/river shapes in the logo. However, a single color logo like the bottom one and the logo option that was ultimately chosen provides much more versatility for the client than my more complex design.</figcaption></figure>
<Figure><img src="assets/img/petlogo.png" alt="pet logo"><figcaption>Pet care company logo for my final Mobile Web project this spring. I wanted something kind of playful, and will take any opportunity to use a slab serif. </figcaption></Figure>
